# DICE GAME
This project is a fun game made to learn the basics about useState Hook in ReactJS.

This project helped me to understand how to use ReactJS more dynamically. In the project I have made an interface in which we have to select a number from 0 to 6 and then roll the dice, if we get the same number that we selected, we get the same points and if we dont then 2 points will be deducted. The interface also contains 2 buttons, 1 for reseting the score and other for showing the rules.
I also used 'styled-components' module in this project which helped me to get ease with my project.

My learnings from the project are :
1. Understanding useState Hook: Learned that useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to functional components.
Understood the syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState).
2. State Initialization: Discovered that the initial state can be any data type (string, number, array, object).
Realized the initial state is set only once, during the initial render.
3. State Management: Understood how to use the setState function to update the state.
Learned that calling setState triggers a re-render of the component.
4. Handling Multiple State Variables: Explored managing multiple state variables by calling useState multiple times.
Understood that each call to useState is independent.
5. Functional Updates: Discovered how to use functional updates to access the previous state value using a function within setState.
6. Dynamic Styling: Learned how to create dynamic and reusable styled components with the styled-components library, and understood how to pass props to styled components to conditionally apply styles based on the component's state or properties.
7. CSS-in-JS Approach: Explored the CSS-in-JS approach, which allows writing actual CSS code within JavaScript files, also appreciated the benefits of scoped styles, which prevent class name collisions and make it easier to maintain and manage styles within a React component.
